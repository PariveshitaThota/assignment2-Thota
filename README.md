# Pariveshita Thota
burger
**Burger** consists of tasty ingredient's with various layers such as Iceburg lettuce, Chicken, Onions, Pickles, and some interesting sauces like **Barbeque**, Mayonnise which add great flavour to the burger. I like it a lot because it is avalaible in many varities both in veg and non veg.
